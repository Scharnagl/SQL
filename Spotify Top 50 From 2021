-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- 


CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,

--Sample Questions:

--What is the average danceability by artist and track? 
SELECT AVG(danceability), artist_name as artist, track_name as song FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist;
    

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity? 
SELECT artist_name as artist, track_name as song, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    WHERE popularity > '90'
    ORDER BY popularity DESC
    LIMIT 10;


--What song has the most BPM?
SELECT artist_name as artist, track_name as song, max(tempo) as BPM FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    ORDER BY BPM DESC
    LIMIT 1;


--What 5 songs are the longest?
SELECT track_name as song, artist_name as artist, duration_ms as length FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    ORDER BY length DESC
