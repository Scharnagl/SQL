#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


--1 How many orders were placed in January? Remember to filter out the blank and incorrect order IDs

SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE length(orderID) = 6
    AND orderID <> 'orderID';


--2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(Product) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE Product='iPhone'
    WHERE length(order_id) = 6
    AND order_id <> 'Order ID';


--3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum FROM customers
    LEFT JOIN FebSales
    ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
    WHERE length(order_id) = 6
    AND order_id <> 'Order ID';


--4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT JanSales.Product, min(JanSales.price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;


--5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).

SELECT sum(Quantity) *price as TTL_Revenue, Product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    GROUP BY Product;


--6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, sum(Quantity) as Sold, sum(Quantity) *price as TTL_Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
    GROUP BY Product;


--7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(distinct customers.acctnum), AVG(Febsales.Quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
    ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
    WHERE FebSales.Quantity>2
    AND length(orderid) = 6 
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, sum(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;

--Second set of inqueries
--1 Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).

SELECT location, count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE location LIKE '%ny%'
    AND length(orderid) = 6 
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
    GROUP BY location
    HAVING count(Quantity) >2;
    

--2 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT distinct Product, sum(Quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE Product LIKE '%headphone%'
    GROUP BY Product;
    

--3 What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, 
    --not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)

SELECT avg(quantity*price) as avg_spt FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb
    JOIN customers as Cust
    WHERE Cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
    AND length(orderid) = 6 
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


--4 What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3,
    --we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).

SELECT sum(quantity)/count(Cust.acctnum) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb
     LEFT JOIN customers as Cust
     ON Cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
     WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
     AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
     

--5 Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT Product, sum(Quantity*price) as ttl_rev FROM BIT_DB.JanSales as Jan
    Group BY Product
    ORDER BY ttl_rev desc
    LIMIT 1;
